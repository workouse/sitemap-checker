## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of this project is a top priority. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you may find.

To report a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue on GitHub. Instead, send an email to [emre.yilmaz@workouse.com](mailto:emre.yilmaz@workouse.com) with the subject line "Security Vulnerability in sitemap-checker".

Please include the following information in your report:

-   A clear and descriptive summary of the vulnerability.
-   The version of Sitemap Checker you are using.
-   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
-   Any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or logs that can help us understand the issue.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will also keep you informed of our progress.

We kindly request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it. We will coordinate with you on the public disclosure of the vulnerability once a fix is in place.

Thank you for helping to keep Sitemap Checker secure.
